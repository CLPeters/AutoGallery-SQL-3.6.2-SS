Overview
--------
This template is an all thumbnail template that will display a top section
that is a "Hall of Fame".  This is slightly different from the standard hall
of fame template example.  Instead of displaying the most productive galleries
from the past 7 days, this breaks up each row into a different day.  The top
row will display the most productive galleries from yesterday, the second row
will display the most productive galleries from 2 days ago, and so on.

There are two other sections which display new galleries and galleries from
yesterday.  This is designed to have a "Build With New" run once per day and
several "Build" type builds run to re-order the hall of fame.

The first GALLERIES section is the hall of fame.  As was previously mentioned, each
row in the hall of fame is dedicated to a specific day.  The first row is the hall
of fame for yesterday, the second row is the hall of fame for 2 days ago, the third
row is the hall of fame for 3 days ago, and the final row is the hall of fame for 4
days ago.  No new galleries will ever show up in this section, it will only display
previously used galleries that have had a chance to accumulate clicks.

The second GALLERIES section is where the new galleries will be added.  20 new thumbnails
will be added in this section each time a "Build With New" is executed.  When a "Build"
type of build is executed, the galleries will be displayed in the same order.

The final GALLERIES section is where the galleries from yesterday will be displayed.
20 thumbnails that were dislayed in the new galleries section yesterday will appear
here.  Notice that the PAGEDUPES option is set to True so that even if a gallery
from yesterday appears in the hall of fame it can also appear in this section.  You
can change that to meet your needs, however if you do disable it you will probably
want to enable the FILL option so that this section will not have empty spots from
the galleries that show in the hall of fame.

Make sure you configure the go.php click tracking script as described in the software
manual and place it in the same directory as your TGP pages.
