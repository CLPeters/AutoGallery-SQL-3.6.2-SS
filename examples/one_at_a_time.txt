Overview
--------
This is a thumbnail only template that is designed to be used for sites where you
will only be doing a "Build With New" many times per day.  Each time you do a 
"Build With New" one new thumbnail will be added to the top of the page.  Most
sites using this type of template will also be using cron to run a "Build With New"
once every 10 to 30 minutes.

There are three sections of thumbnails on the page, one for the newly added galleries,
one for the galleries from yesterday, and one for the galleries from two days ago.  In
all sections there will be 20 thumbnails with 4 rows and 5 columns.

The first GALLERIES section is where the 1 new gallery will be added each time
a "Build With New" is executed.  If you run a "Build" the same gallery that was
previously there will still appear in that slot.

The second GALLERIES section is where the 1 new gallery will move the next time
you do a "Build With New".  This will have the affect of moving every thumbnail over
one slot and removing the last thumbnail from the table.  This is a good way to
build up  clicks on the newly added galleries so that they can be sorted by their 
productivity when they move to the yesterday and two-day old sections.

The third GALLERIES section will display the 20 most productive galleries from 
the previous day that were displayed in the top section.

The final GALLERIES section will display the 20 most productive galleries from 
the two days ago that were displayed in the top section.

Make sure you configure the go.php click tracking script as described in the software
manual and place it in the same directory as your TGP pages.
