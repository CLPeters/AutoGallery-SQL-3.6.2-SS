<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL's template system allows you to control the HTML that is displayed by your submit form.  Your templates can
be changed at any time through the control panel.  This makes it quick and easy to integrate the submit form into
your existing site design.

<br />
<br />

<b>Control Panel Editing Interface</b>

<br />
<br />

All changes to your submit form templates will be made through the control panel.  From the control panel menu, locate and click on the
Script Pages link in the Templates section.  AutoGallery SQL will load a page where you will be able to select which of the template files you want
to edit.  Select the template you want to edit from the list, and press the Load Template button.

<br />
<br />

You will be returned to the same page, however now there will be a large text input box where you will edit your HTML code.  The first
time you do this, the text input box will contain AutoGallery SQL's default HTML.  You can edit that HTML or paste your own HTML code into
this text input box.  When you are satisfied with the changes you have made, click on the Save button at the top or bottom of the page.

<br />
<br />

All of the changes you make will be immediate.  The next time you visit the submit form, the updated template will be used.

<br />
<br />

<b>Control Structures</b>

<br />
<br />

These templates will use some control structures, however you should not need to edit or add any to your customized templates.  The only thing you may
need to do is move the control structures to different locations in the template.  For that reason, they will only briefly be covered here.

<ul>
<b>If</b><br />
The If control structure is a conditional control structure.  It basically says If something is true, then output the HTML that is enclosed.
All of the If control structures have been commented so that you know what they do.  You should be able to move them around the template without
a problem.  In most cases you will not want to remove these from the templates.

<br />
<br />

<b>Loop</b><br />
The Loop control structure allows several template values to be printed out without duplicating them.  You should be able to move them around the
template without a problem.  In most cases you will not want to remove these from the templates.

<br />
<br />

<b>Include</b><br />
The Include control structure allows you to include the contents of a file in your page.  The file contents will be placed exactly where the Include
control structure is located.  Note that the Include control structure is a special case and does not have an End tag.  This has been used to include
the submit.css file, which contains a style sheet, on each of the submit form templates.
</ul>

Each of the template files has it's own set of valid template values.
