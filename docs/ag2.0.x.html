<div style="width: 80%">

<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

This document will descibe the steps necessary to upgrade from AutoGallery 2.0.x to AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x.  This upgrade process will work
only for AutoGallery 2.0.x.  The upgrade process will allow you to keep your current galleries, however, your templates cannot be imported.
You should allow time to customize the new templates once your upgrade is complete.

<br />
<br />

<b>Export Your Data</b>

<br />
<br />

First you need to export your AutoGallery 2.0.x data into a format that AutoGallery SQL can understand.  This is simple to do with the export utility included
with the 3.6.x version.  In the utilities directory of the software distribution you will find a file named ag2.0.x.cgi.  Upload that file to your
server in ASCII mode to the same directory where your AutoGallery 2.0.x ag.pl file is located.  Set it's permissions to 755 and then bring it up in your browser.
It may take a few minutes for the data export to complete.  Once it does you will see a message telling you to continue to the next step of the
upgrade process.

<br />
<br />

The export script has created one file in the data directory of your AutoGallery 2.0.x installation.  FTP into your server and download the file named upgrade.dat.
<span class="important">It is very important that you download the upgrade.dat file in binary mode or  it will be corrupted and will not be readable by AutoGallery SQL</span>.

<br />
<br />

<b>Decision Time</b>

<br />
<br />

At this point you need to decide if you want to install AutoGallery SQL in a new directory or keep the same directory name.  The benefit of installing 
in a new directory is that you can keep AutoGallery running while you work with the new AutoGallery SQL installation.  The benefit of keeping the
same directory name is that you will not have to change any links or bookmarks to the script.

<br />


<ul>
<b>Installing in a New Directory</b>

<br />
<br />

If you have decided to install AutoGallery SQL in a new directory, go ahead and create that directory and do a normal installation of AutoGallery SQL as
described in the <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a> section of the software manual.  Do not copy any of the files from your 
AutoGallery 2.0.x installation into the new directory.  Once you have completed the installation, skip ahead to the Importing Your Data section of this page.

<br />
<br />

<b>Keeping the Same Directory</b>

<br />
<br />

If you want to keep the same directory name you will need to rename the current directory.  For example, if AutoGallery 2.0.x is installed in a directory
named tgp, change the name to tgp_old.  Once the directory has been renamed, create a new empty directory with the name of the original directory.  Do a normal
installation of AutoGallery SQL as described in the <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a> section of the software manual.  Do not copy any of the
files from your AutoGallery 2.0.x installation into the new directory.  Once you have completed the installation, skip ahead to the Importing Your Data 
section of this page.
</ul>

<b>Importing Your Data</b>

<br />
<br />

Once you have your AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x installation up and working properly, you can import the AutoGallery 2.0.x data.   FTP into your server and upload the upgrade.dat file
to the data directory of your 3.6.x installation. <span class="important">It is very important that you upload the upgrade.dat file in binary mode or it will
be corrupted and will not be readable by the 3.6.x  installation</span>.

<br />
<br />

Next you will need to login to your AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x control panel.  Locate and click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.
AutoGallery SQL will then display a page where you will find a box at the top titled "Database Backup/Restore".  In the "Backup Filename" field enter upgrade.dat.
Once the field is filled in, click on the Restore button.  AutoGallery SQL will read the data files and import the data from your 2.0.x installation.  This may take
a few minutes, so allow enough time for it to complete.  After enough time has elapsed, you can continue begin using the software as usual.

<br />
<br />

<b>Removing AutoGallery 2.0.x</b>

<br />
<br />

Once your data has been imported and you are sure that you no longer need the AutoGallery 2.0.x installation you can delete it from your server.  Simply 
delete all of the AutoGallery 2.0.x files and folders.  Once they have been deleted, the removal is finished.
