<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

For very high traffic sites it may be useful to split the load between two servers, and have one that serves all of the preview thumbnail files separate
from the one that serves the HTML files for your TGP pages.  With the ftpthumbs.cgi utility script, this can be done.

<br />
<br />

<b>Requirements</b>

<br />
<br />

This script makes use of the Net::FTP Perl module, which will need to be installed on your server before you can use this script.  If you need to provide
your server administrator with the location of Net::FTP, it can be found at 
<a href="../../../../external.html?link=http://search.cpan.org/~gbarr/libnet-1.19/" target="_blank" class="link">http://search.cpan.org/~gbarr/libnet-1.19/</a>

<br />
<br />

<b>How It Works</b>

<br />
<br />

This script uses an FTP connection to transfer your thumbnails from the server where AutoGallery SQL is installed to a remote server.  During this process
the Thumbnail URL in the database will be updated to point to the remote server for every gallery that has it's thumbnail transferred there.  This function
only works when you run this script, any new galleries that get added or thumbnails that are created through the control panel will have their thumbnails
stored on the local server until you run this script again.  If you plan on hosting all of your thumbnails from the remote server, you will want to setup this
script to run by cron once a day (or at whatever interval you like) so it can transfer any new thumbnails that have been created.

<br />
<br />

If your remote thumbnail hosting server goes offline, the thumbnail images will not appear on your TGP pages, so you should take that into account when 
deciding whether or not to use this feature.  You will want to make sure that you are using a very stable server so that your thumbs will always be available
for surfers to view when they visit your TGP page.

<br />
<br />

<b>Configuring the ftpthumbs.cgi Script</b>

<br />
<br />

You will need to edit the ftpthumbs.cgi script before you can use it.  It is located in the utilities directory of the AutoGallery SQL software
distribution and can be edited in your favorite text editor (we recommend <a href="../../../../external.html?link=http://www.editplus.com/" target="_blank" class="link">EditPlus</a>
for Windows users).  Once you have that file opened in your text editor, you will find several variable settings near the top of that file.  
Each of the variables that needs to be set is described below.

<ul>
$remote_url - The full URL on the remote server where the thumbnail files will be served from<br />
$ftp_host - The FTP hostname of the remote server where the thumbnail files will be transferred<br />
$ftp_user - The FTP username to login to the remote server<br />
$ftp_pass - The FTP password to login to the remote server<br />
$ftp_port - The port number that the remote FTP server is running on<br />
$ftp_dir - The directory on the remote server that the program needs to change into after logging in
</ul>

Once you have those variables set, upload the ftpthumbs.cgi script to your server in ASCII mode.  It will need to be placed in the same directory
where the ags.pl and common.pl files are located.  Set it's permissions to 700 once it has been uploaded.

<br />
<br />

It is also highly recommended that you make a backup of your gallery database and preview thumbnails before you run this script.  You can backup your
gallery database and thumbnails using the software's built in database export or database backup utilities.

<br />
<br />

<b>Running the ftpthumbs.cgi Script</b>

<br />
<br />

The ftpthumbs.cgi script must be run from the command line of your server, it cannot be accessed through a browser.  You will need SSH or telnet 
access to your server in order to use this script, or you will need to run it through cron at specific intervals.

<br />
<br />

You can now login to the server through telnet or SSH and change into the directory where the ftpthumbs.cgi script is located.  It is recommended
that you run the ftpthumbs.cgi script during off-peak hours, since it will be using some of your available server bandwidth to transfer the thumbnail
files to the remote server.  Execute the following command to begin the thumbnail transfer process:

<br />
<br />

perl ftpthumbs.cgi

<br />
<br />

On some servers you may need to specify the full path to perl, which might look like this (where /usr/local/bin is the directory where perl is located):

<br />
<br />

/usr/local/bin/perl ftpthumbs.cgi

<br />
<br />

When you execute this command, there will be no output from the script, but you will not be returned to the command prompt until it has finished executing.
You should allow several minutes for the transfer process to be completed, depending on how many preview thumbnails you have.  When the script is done it simply
return you to the command line of your server.  You can now login to the AutoGallery SQL control panel and use the Display Galleries interface to view the galleries
and make sure the thumbs are showing up properly.

<br />
<br />

<b>Running the ftpthumbs.cgi Script Through Cron</b>

<br />
<br />

To automate the process of transferring the thumbnail files to your remote server, you can setup the ftpthumbs.cgi script to run as a cron job at whatever interval
you specify.  For the basics of setting up a cron job, see the <a href="cron.html" class="link">Cron</a> section of the software manual.  Once you have figured out
the interval you want to use, you can setup your crontab entry along with any other AutoGallery SQL entries you have.  For example:

<br />
<br />

0 6,18 * * * /full/directory/path/to/ftpthumbs.cgi &amp;

<br />
<br />

This example would run the ftpthumbs.cgi script twice per day; once at 6am and once at 6pm.  Note that the /full/directory/path/to/ portion would be replaced with the
directory path on your server to the directory where the ftpthumbs.cgi script is located.  It is also important to have the &amp; character at the end.  This tells it
to run in the background so that the server's cron system can go about it's business and not wait for the gallery scanner to finish it's task.
