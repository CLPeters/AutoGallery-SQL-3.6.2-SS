<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

With AutoGallery SQL's e-mail templates you can specify what information you want in an e-mail, what type of e-mail to send (text or HTML), and you can even
include attachments with your e-mail.

<br />
<br />

<b>Control Panel Editing Interface</b>

<br />
<br />

All changes to your e-mail templates will be made through the control panel.  From the control panel menu, locate and click on the E-mail Messages
link in the Templates section.  AutoGallery SQL will load a page where you will be able to select which of the template files you want to edit.  Select the
template you want to edit from the list, and press the Load E-mail button.

<br />
<br />

You will be returned to the same page, however now there will be several text input fields where you will enter the information to be used for the
e-mail.  The first time you load a template, the default values will be loaded and displayed in these fields.  You can edit them how you like.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>Subject</b> - This will be the subject of the e-mail<br />
<b>Text</b> - If you want to send e-mails in text format, fill in this field with your message<br /> 
<b>HTML</b> - If you want to send e-mails in HTML format, fill in this field with your message<br /> 
<b>Attachments</b> - If you want to attach anything to the e-mail, select each item you want to attach
</ul>

<br />

When you are satisfied with the changes you have made, click on the Save button at the top or bottom of the page.  All of the changes you make will
be immediate.  The next time that e-mail is sent, the updated template will be used.

<br />
<br />

<b>Attachments</b>

<br />
<br />

If you want to attach any files to your e-mail messages you will first need to upload those files to the server.  They should be uploaded to the data/attachments
directory of your AutoGallery SQL installation.  Once you have one or more files in that directory, the attachments selection field will be displayed when you edit your
e-mail templates.  Only the attachments that you select will be sent, and you can select as many as you want.

<br />
<br />


<b>Template Values</b>

<br />
<br />

Each of the template files has it's own set of valid template values.
