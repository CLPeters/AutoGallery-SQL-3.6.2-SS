<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

With AutoGallery SQL you can make changes to the options at any time through the control panel.  The options control the basic features of
the software, from where your preview thumbnails are stored to what timezone you are located in.  All of this is done through an easy to
use web-based interface.

<br />
<br />

<b>Making Changes</b>

<br />
<br />

To make changes to the options, locate and click on the Edit Options link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load
a page where you will be able to see all of the available options.  All of the options are divided up into sub-sections so you can more easily
locate the option you are looking for.

<br />
<br />

All of the options have a [?] link after them.  You can click on this link to get more information on the field and an example setting.

<br />
<br />

Once you have made the changes that you want, just press the Save Options button at the bottom of the page.  AutoGallery SQL will save your changes
and return you to the options page.  The changes you make are immediate.

<br />
<br />

<b>Important Notes</b>

<br />
<br />

If you change any of the options in the URLs & Files section, you may also need to set some directory permissions on your server.  If
you are not on a server where CGI scripts are run with suexec, you will need to change the permissions on the directory that Thumbnail URL points to.
That directory will need 777 permissions.

<br />
<br />

Before you enable the auto-approve feature of the software you need to process all pending galleries.  Any galleries that are still pending after
you turn on the auto-approve option will no longer be accessable to you.

<br />
<br />

Before you disable the confirmation e-mail feature of the software you need to process all of the unconfirmed galleries.  Any galleries that are still
unconfirmed after you turn off the confirmation e-mail option will no longer be accessable to you.
