<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

To help ensure that the e-mail addresses being submitted with galleries are valid, AutoGallery SQL includes a confirmation
e-mail feature.  If you have this option enabled, an e-mail message will be sent to the gallery submitter immediately after
their gallery has been submitted.  They will need to visit a link in that e-mail message in order to confirm their submission.
This document contains additional information about the confirmation e-mail.

<br />
<br />

<b>Confirmation Options</b>

<br />
<br />

There are two different ways that the software can handle gallery confirmations.  The first is to require that the submitter
visit a URL and copy a string of characters into a web-based form field.  The second is to simply have a clickable URL in the
confirmation e-mail that the submitter can click on to confirm their submission.  There are benifits to both methods, which will
be explained further.

<ul>
<li><b>Enter String on Web-Based Form</b><br />
The default action of the software is to require that submitters enter a string of characters in a web-based form field in order
to confirm their gallery submission.  This method requires more work from the gallery submitter, but is also more secure from being
abused by automated gallery submission programs.  The software's e-mail templates are setup by default for this method of
confirmation e-mails, and to use this method you need to make sure that the 'Allow confirmation e-mail to contain a clickable
confirmation link?' option is not checked.

<br />
<br />

<li><b>Clickable Link</b><br />
If you check the 'Allow confirmation e-mail to contain a clickable confirmation link?' option in the software's Edit Options interface
you can then modify the confirmation e-mail template so that a clickable link is available to the submitter.  This method is less secure
against automated gallery submission programs but is less time consuming for the submitter.  To use this option you will need to edit
the email_confirm.tpl e-mail template.  Instead of having the confirmation URL and ID code separate, you will need to put them together
into a single URL.  If you were using the default template you would replace ##Confirm_URL## with this:

<br />
<br />

##Confirm_URL##?ID=##Confirm_ID##

<br />
<br />

Also be sure to indicate that all they need to do is click on that link; it is not necessary to enter their confirmation code on a web-based
form when using this confirmation method.
