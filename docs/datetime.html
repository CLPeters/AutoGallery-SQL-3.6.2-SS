<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL allows you to set the format that you want dates and times displayed in.  Many countries use differing formats to display
their dates and times, so this feature will allow you to have your dates and times in a format that the majority of your visitors
will understand.  The date and time format system used by AutoGallery SQL is based on the date and time format feature of MySQL.  If you have
experience working with MySQL date and time formats, you'll have no problem with these.  Even if you don't, these formats are very 
straightforward and easy to understand.

<br />
<br />

<b>Changing Formats</b>

<br />
<br />

The date and time formats you want to use are configured through AutoGallery SQL's Options interface.  In the control panel, click on the
Edit Options link in the Setup section of the menu.  The options page will load, and you can scroll down to the Other
Options section of the page.  In that section you will find the Date Format and Time Format fields. This is where you
will make the changes to your date and time formats.  Once you have made the changes you want, press the Save Options button to
save your new settings.

<br />
<br />

Date and time format specifiers consist of a percent character followed by an alphabetic character.  You can find a complete list of these
specifiers below for both dates and times.  Using a combination of these specifiers you can create complete date and time formats.  Note that
AutoGallery SQL will only pay attention to the percent-alphabetic character combinations, all other characters in your date or time format will be left
alone.  This allows you to use separators such as forward-slashes, dashes, and colons as you like.
