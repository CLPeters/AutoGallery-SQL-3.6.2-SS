<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

As you may know, finding a great host for your website can be very difficult. Because of this, it is
sometimes required that you move to a new server at a new hosting company. This document will give you
an overview of what needs to be done in order to transfer AutoGallery SQL and your data to a new server.

<br />
<br />

<b>Backup Your Data</b>

<br />
<br />

The first thing you will need to do is backup your MySQL database and AutoGallery SQL datafiles from the old server.
This is easily done through the control panel using the database backup feature.  Follow the instructions in the
<a href="backup.html" class="link">Database Backup</a> section of the software manual to backup your data.  The backup
feature will backup most things for you, however if you have edited any of the .tpl template files you will need to
transfer those and your preview thumbnails to your new server seperately.

<br />
<br />

<b>Install on the New Server</b>

<br />
<br />

Next, you will need to install AutoGallery SQL on your new server. It is very important that you do not copy any files
over from your old server. You should proceed with the installation as if it is the first time it is being installed.
Follow the instructions in <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a> section of the manual to complete the
installation. Once you have done that, you can upload any customized .tpl files to your templates directory, if you haven't already.

<br />
<br />

<b>Restoring Your Data</b>

<br />
<br />

After you have the new installation done on your new server, follow the instructions in the <a href="backup.html" class="link">Database Backup</a>
section of the software manual to restore your data.  If you have not already done so, you should transfer your preview thumbnails and edited
template files from the old server.  Be sure to set the permissions on all of the preview thumbnails to 666.  Once your data has been restored
you can continue using the software as normal.  The first thing you will want to do is rebuild all of your pages so that they will display 
the HTML and galleries from your previous installation.
