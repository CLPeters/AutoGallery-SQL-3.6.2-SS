<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

If you are reading this part of the AutoGallery SQL manual, you most likely just had it installed on your server.  If that is the case, there are a number of things
you will want to do to get started.  This document will cover the items you will most likely want to do right away, and it will also point you to other parts
of the manual where you can find more information about each specific step.

<br />
<br />

<b>Important Notes</b>

<br />
<br />

You may feel like snooping around your AutoGallery SQL installation with an FTP client to see what files have been installed, and that is fine.  What you shouldn't do
is delete or modify any of the files or directories that have been installed.  All of the changes that you will need to make are done through the control panel.
You should never try to manually edit any of the files that are located in the AutoGallery SQL installation directory or any of it's subdirectories.  Doing so will most
likely end up with AutoGallery SQL no longer functioning properly.  Unless you are specifically instructed by the tech support staff or the documentation to do
something with the files, you should avoid doing anything to them.

<br />
<br />


<b>Setting up an Access List</b>

<br />
<br />

While this step is not required, it is very highly recommend and will add an additional layer of security to your installation.  Before you do anything else, you should
setup an IP address access list for your AutoGallery SQL control panel.  This will restrict who is allowed to run some of the critical functions in the control panel interface
by their IP address, so even if someone is able to access your control panel they should not be able to compromise your server.  There is a complete section of the software
manual dedicated to <a href="accesslist.html" class="link">the access list feature</a>, so please review that now.

<br />
<br />

<b>Logging Into The Control Panel</b>

<br />
<br />

If you haven't already, go ahead and login to your AutoGallery SQL control panel.  You may want to bookmark the control panel URL so you can quickly access it when
you need to.

<br />
<br />

The left hand side of the control panel contains the menu, which you will use to access the control panel's features.  When you click a link in the
menu, AutoGallery SQL will load up the appropriate page in the main portion of the browser window.  We recommend that you keep your browser window maximized at
all times when working in the control panel.  It was designed for a screen resolution of 1024x768 or larger.

<br />
<br />

<b>Setting Up Categories</b>

<br />
<br />

Before you can start accepting gallery submissions you will need to setup at least one category.  This is easy to do through the control panel, and you
can update, add, or delete categories at any time.  The <a href="categories.html" class="link">Categories</a> section of the manual covers managing your
categories in detail.

<br />
<br />

<b>Setting Up Reciprocal Links</b>

<br />
<br />

If you have AutoGallery SQL setup to reject galleries that do not have a reciprocal link, you will need to create at least one reciprocal link so AutoGallery SQL will know
what to look for.  Even if you are not requiring a reciprocal link, it is recommended that you set them up.  If you do, AutoGallery SQL will be able to tell you if the
gallery has a link back to your site or not.  For details on setting up your reciprocal links, see the <a href="recips.html" class="link">Reciprocal
Links</a> section of the manual.

<br />
<br />

<b>Creating Your First TGP Page</b>

<br />
<br />

Before you go much further you probably want to configure your first TGP page.  To add a new page, use the Manage Pages interface.  This will allow you to add, remove
and update the TGP pages that AutoGallery SQL will be creating for you.  More information can be found in the <a href="managepages.html" class="link">Managing TGP Pages</a>
section of the software manual.

<br />
<br />

Once you have added a page, you can create it by running the Build Pages function in the control panel menu.  For more information on how the page building process
works, please see the <a href="buildpages.html" class="link">Page Building Overview</a> section of the software manual.

<br />
<br />

<b>Setting Up Your Templates</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL comes installed with default templates which you may or may not like.  Templates control the layout of everything from your submit form, to e-mails,
to your TGP page itself, and all of them can be edited through the control panel.  Editing all of the templates can take time, so it may not be something
you want to do right away, but you probably eventually will.  There are sections of this manual dedicated to each type of template, so please read them
over before you start making changes.

<br />
<br />

<b>Testing the Submit Form</b>

<br />
<br />

If you've made it this far, you're probably ready to accept your first gallery submission.  You can point your browser to the submit.cgi script to submit
your first gallery.  It is always a good idea to test the submit form anytime you make changes to the AutoGallery SQL
options.  This will make sure that is doing what you expect and will prevent you from losing any gallery submissions.  The 
<a href="galleries.html" class="link">Galleries</a> section of the manual covers the gallery submission process in more detail.

<br />
<br />

<b>From Here</b>

<br />
<br />

The steps above cover the major things you will want to do to get started with AutoGallery SQL.  Of course there are many other optional things you can do, but
this will get you off to a good start.  There are many other sections of the manual which have not been covered in this document.  It is highly recommended
that you read the entire manual.  It may take some time to get through, but it will be worth it in the end.
