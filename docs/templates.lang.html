<b>Language Settings</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL allows you to make changes to the error messages and other text that is displayed to webmasters who submit to your TGP.  All of these
settings are controlled through the language file, which can be edited through the control panel.

<br />
<br />

<b>Control Panel Editing Interface</b>

<br />
<br />

All changes to your language settings will be made through the control panel.  To edit your language settings, locate and click on the Language File
link in the Templates section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load a page where you can edit all of the available language settings.  All of
the items on the page with an E_ prefix are error messages.  The other items are used in conjunction with the error messages.  Each of the items should
be self-explanitory by reading the existing text.

<br />
<br />

Once you have made the changes you want, press the Save Settings button.  AutoGallery SQL will save all of the changes and return you to the same page.
