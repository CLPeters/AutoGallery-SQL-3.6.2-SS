<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL's database backup function allows you to quickly make a backup file that contains all of the data you would need in case
of an emergency such as a server crash, database failure, or in the case when you need to move your site to a new server.  If this were to ever happen
you can easily restore all of your data and get back up and running quickly.

<br />
<br />

<b>Backing Up Your Database</b>

<br />
<br />

To backup your database, locate and click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will then
display a page where you will find a few different database functions.  The first box is for the database backup and restore functions.  To backup
your database all you need to do is fill in a filename, decide on the two checkbox options, and then press the Backup button.  The two checkbox options are:

<ul>
<b>Include thumbnails</b> - Check this option if you want to include all of the preview thumbnails for your galleries in the database backup
file.  Note that this option can use large amounts of disk space, depending on how many thumbnails you have, so be sure that your server has
plenty of disk space available and that the disk quota for your account has enough room available as well.<br /><br />
<b>Include annotation files</b> - Check this option if you want to include the files from the data/annotations directory in your backup.  These
are the font files and overlay images for your thumbnail annotations.
</ul>

If you do not check those options, you will need to manually make backups of your preview thumbnails and annotation files if you want to have them
stored in a safe place.

<br />
<br />

The backup process may take a few minutes, so be sure to give it time to complete.  To download the backup file for safe keeping, login to your
server using FTP and change into the data directory of your AutoGallery SQL installation. Locate the backup file you specified when you ran the
backup function.  You can download this file to your local computer for safe keeping.  <span class="important">Important Download Instructions</span>
When transferring the backup file, make sure you transfer it in binary mode, not ASCII.  Downloading the file in ASCII mode will corrupt it and you
will not be able to restore your data.

<br />
<br />

Note that the backup process does not backup your script page templates.  To backup your script page templates
download the following files from the templates directory of your AutoGallery SQL installation:

<ul>
All templates starting with:<br />
    confirm_<br />
    email_<br />
    partner_<br />
    remind_<br />
    report_<br />
    submit_
</ul>

<b>Restoring Your Database</b>

<br />
<br />

The database restore function can be used to restore your data from a backup file that was created by the same version of AutoGallery SQL.  For example,
if you created the backup file with version 3.6.1, you will need to use exactly that version to restore the backup file.  Using older or newer versions of
AutoGallery SQL may prevent the data restore process from working correctly.

<br />
<br />

The first step is to upload the backup file (the one created with the datbase backup function) to the data directory of your AutoGallery SQL installation.
<span class="important">Important Upload Instructions</span> When transferring the backup file, make sure you transfer it in binary mode, not ASCII.

<br />
<br />

To restore your database, locate and click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will then
display a page where you will find a few different database functions.  The first box is for the database backup and restore functions.  Enter the
filename of the backup file in the text entry field and then click on the Restore button.  This process may take a few minutes, so be sure to give
it time to complete. After enough time has elapsed, you can continue using the software as usual.

<br />
<br />

If you have made backups of your script page templates, you will need to upload those now.  Make sure you upload the template
files in ASCII mode and the preview thumbnails in binary mode.  Set the permissions on the template files to 666.

<br />
<br />

If you did not use the options to backup the thumbnail and annotation files, you will also need to upload those at this time.  The thumbnail files
will need to be uploaded to the directory pointed to by the Thumbnail URL setting and have their permissions set to 666.  Annotation files will need
to be uploaded to the data/annotations directory and have their permissions set to 666.
