<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

With AutoGallery SQL it is possible to display icons next to any of the galleries on your TGP page.  This can be useful to draw attention to 
specific galleries.  Icons can be any HTML you want, including images, text, or anything else.  They are a good way to highlight your own galleries,
or you can put them next to partner galleries to improve their productivity.

<br />
<br />

<b>Adding an Icon</b>

<br />
<br />

In the control panel locate and click on the Manage Icons link in the Templates section of the menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load a page
where you will be able to enter the necessary information to create an icon.  Each of the fields on that page is described below.

<br />

<ul>
<b>Identifier</b> - This is a short identifier which will help you to recognize what the icon is.<br />
<b>HTML</b> - This is the complete HTML that should be used for the icon.
</ul>

Once all of the options have been filled in how you want them, press the Add/Update button.  The new icon will be added and you will
be returned to the Manage Icons page where you can create more icons if you wish.
<br />
<br />

<b>Updating an Icon</b>

<br />
<br />

To edit an icon, select it's identifier from the drop down list at the top of the page.  AutoGallery SQL will fill in the form fields with the
Identifier and HTML for that icon.  You can then make any changes to the HTML for the icon that you wish.  Once you are completed making the
changes you want, press the Add/Update Account button.  AutoGallery SQL will update the icon with the new HTML and display a confirmation message
at the top of the page.

<br />
<br />

<b>Deleting an Icon</b>

<br />
<br />

To delete an icon click, select it's identifier from the drop down list at the top of the page.  AutoGallery SQL will fill in the form fields with the
Identifier and HTML for that icon.  You can then press the Delete button and AutoGallery SQL will delete that icon.

<br />
<br />

<b>Displaying Icons</b>

<br />
<br />

To display icons next to galleries, you first need to setup your TGP page template.  In the HTML option of either your TEMPLATE or GALLERIES directives
you will need to use the ##Icons## template value.  Place it where you want the icon to appear.  Once you have done that, save the HTML for that TGP page.

<br />
<br />

Now you need to assign an icon to the gallery that you want it to appear next to.  This is done through the
Display Galleries interface, and is described in the <a href="galleries.html" class="link">Submitted Galleries</a> section of the manual.
