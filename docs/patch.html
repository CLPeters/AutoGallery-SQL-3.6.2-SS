<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

We will be updating AutoGallery SQL when necessary to fix any bugs and add small features.  These releases can be recognized by a change 
in the third digit of the software version number.  For example a change from version 3.6.2 to 3.6.3 is a patch release.  When these patches
are released you should upgrade your installation with the new version.  This document contains instructions for doing just that.

<br />
<br />

<b>Patching</b>

<br />
<br />

Patching your installation is very simple.  All you need to do is upload the new files from the new version to your server.  All of the files that 
need to be uploaded are listed below. You should not run any upgrade scripts when patching your installation, those are only used when upgrading
from a previous major release.

<br />

<ul>
<b>/cgi-bin/tgp</b><br />
ags.pl<br />
code.cgi<br />
common.pl<br />
compiler.pl<br />
confirm.cgi<br />
cron.cgi<br />
http.pl<br />
image.pl<br />
md5.pl<br />
mysql.pl<br />
partner.cgi<br />
remind.cgi<br />
report.cgi<br />
scanner.cgi<br />
size.pl<br />
submit.cgi<br />
thumb.cgi

<br /><br />

<b>/cgi-bin/tgp/admin</b><br />
admin.cgi<br />
main.cgi<br />
menu.cgi<br />
patch.cgi<br />
review.cgi<br />
xml.cgi

<br /><br />

<b>/cgi-bin/tgp/data</b><br />
language<br />
tables

<br /><br />

<b>/cgi-bin/tgp/templates</b><br />
All admin_*.tpl, review_*.tpl and .js files<br />
submit_crop.tpl
</ul>

Once all of the files have been uploaded, change the permissions on the cron.cgi and scanner.cgi files to 777.  You can then
bring up the patch.cgi script in your browser which will update those two files with the correct settings.  After that has been
successfully completed, change the permissions back to 755 on the cron.cgi and scanner.cgi files.  

<br />
<br />

The final step is to login to the control panel and visit the Edit Options interface.  You do not need to change any of the settings, 
simply press the button to save your current settings which will force the software to run through a check to ensure all of the files
and directories it needs have been created.  You are now complete with the patching process.

<br />
<br />

If you are using the click tracking feature of the software you will also need to configure the new version of the go.php file
as described in the Click Tracking section of the software manual.  Replace the old copy with the new copy.

<br />
<br />

<b>Important Notes</b>

<br />
<br />

If Perl 5 is not located at /usr/bin/perl be sure to update the first line of all .cgi files with the correct path to Perl on your server.

<br />
<br />

Make sure you upload all of the files in ASCII mode!

<br />
<br />

It is not necessary to delete any files from your server before you upload the updated scripts. If you do delete any files, make sure you
reset all permissions on the files you upload.  All file permissions are covered in the <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a>
section of the manual.
