<span class="large">Upgrading From AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x or 3.1.x</span>
</div>

<br />

<div style="width: 80%">

<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

This document will descibe the steps necessary to upgrade from AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x or 3.1.x to AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x.  This upgrade process will work
only for AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x or 3.1.x.  If you are using an older version of AutoGallery Pro, you will first need to upgrade it to 3.0.x or follow the
upgrade instructions for the version you are using .  The upgrade process will allow you to keep your current galleries, partners, blacklist and
a few other settings.  Your templates, however, cannot be imported, so you should allow time to customize the new templates once your upgrade is
complete.

<br />
<br />

<b>Make a Backup</b>

<br />
<br />

The first thing you should do is a database backup from the control panel of your AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x installation.   This is covered in the
AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x software manual, so follow those steps to make a backup.

<br />
<br />

<b>Export Your Data</b>

<br />
<br />

Now you need to export your AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x data into a format that AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x can understand.  This is simple to do with the export utility included
with AutoGallery SQL.  In the utilities directory of the AutoGallery SQL distribution you will find a file named agp3.x.x.cgi.  Upload that file to your
server in ASCII mode to the same directory where your AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x agp.pl file is located.  Set it's permissions to 755 and then bring it up in your browser.
It may take a few minutes for the data export to complete.

<br />
<br />

The export script has created a file in the data directory of your AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x installation that contains the information that will be imported into
your AutoGallery SQL installation.  FTP into your server and download the file named upgrade.dat.  <span class="important">It is very important that you download
the upgrade.dat file in binary mode or it will be corrupted and will not be readable by AutoGallery SQL</span>.

<br />
<br />

<b>Decision Time</b>

<br />
<br />

At this point you need to decide if you want to install AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x in a new directory or keep the same directory name.  The benefit of installing 
in a new directory is that you can keep AutoGallery Pro running while you work with the new AutoGallery SQL installation.  The benefit of keeping the
same directory name is that you will not have to change any links or bookmarks to the script.

<br />


<ul>
<b>Installing in a New Directory</b>

<br />
<br />

If you have decided to install AutoGallery SQL in a new directory, go ahead and create that directory and do a normal installation of AutoGallery SQL as
described in the <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a> section of the software manual.  Do not copy any of the files from your 
AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x installation into the new directory.  Once you have completed the installation, skip ahead to the Importing Your Data section of this page.

<br />
<br />

<b>Keeping the Same Directory</b>

<br />
<br />

If you want to keep the same directory name you will need to rename the current directory.  For example, if AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x is installed in a directory
named tgp, change the name to tgp_old.  Once the directory has been renamed, create a new empty directory with the name of the original directory.  Do a normal
installation of AutoGallery SQL as described in the <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a> section of the software manual.  Do not copy any of the
files from your AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x installation into the new directory.  Once you have completed the installation, skip ahead to the Importing Your Data 
section of this page.
</ul>

<b>Importing Your Data</b>

<br />
<br />

Once you have your AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x installation up and working properly, you can import the AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x data.  FTP into your server and upload
the upgrade.dat file to the data directory of your AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x installation.  <span class="important">It is very important that you upload the 
upgrade.dat file in binary mode or it will be corrupted and will not be readable by the AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x installation</span>.

<br />
<br />

Next you will need to login to your AutoGallery SQL 3.6.x control panel.  Locate and click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.
AutoGallery SQL will then display a page where you will find a box at the top titled "Database Backup/Restore".  In the "Backup Filename" field enter upgrade.dat.
Once the field is filled in, click on the Restore button.  AutoGallery SQL will read the data file and import the data from your AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x installation.
This may take a few minutes, so allow enough time for it to complete.  After enough time has elapsed, you can continue using the software as usual.

<br />
<br />

<b>Removing AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x</b>

<br />
<br />

Once your data has been imported and you are sure that you no longer need the AutoGallery Pro 3.0.x installation you can delete it from your server.  Simply 
delete all of the AutoGallery Pro 3.x.x files and folders.  Once they have been deleted, the removal is finished.
