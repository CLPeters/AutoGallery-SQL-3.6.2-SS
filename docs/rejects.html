<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

With AutoGallery SQL it is possible to create customized e-mails that represent the most common reasons you reject galleries.  Then, while you are processing newly
submitted galleries you will be able to select from these customized e-mails and send them out to the galleries that you reject.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="add">Adding</a></b>

<br />
<br />

To add a rejection e-mail, locate and click on the Rejection E-mails link in the Gallery Control section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load a
page where you can enter all of the settings for your rejection e-mail.

<ul>
<b>Identifier</b> - This is what will appear when you are processing galleries<br />
<b>Subject</b> - This will be the subject of the e-mail<br />
<b>Text</b> - If you want to send e-mails in text format, fill in this field with your message<br /> 
<b>HTML</b> - If you want to send e-mails in HTML format, fill in this field with your message<br /> 
<b>Attachments</b> - If you want to attach anything to the e-mail, select each item you want to attach
</ul>


Once you have entered everything how you want it, press the Save E-mail button.  AutoGallery SQL will save this e-mail and allow you to select it
the next time you are processing galleries.
<br />
<br />

<b><a name="update">Updating</a></b>

<br />
<br />

To update a rejection e-mail, make your way to the Rejection E-mails interface in the control panel.  Select the e-mail that you want to update
from the drop down menu at the top of the page, and then press the Load E-mail button.  AutoGallery SQL will load the e-mail and fill the form fields for
you.  You can then make the changes that you wish, and once you are done press the Save E-mail button.  Note that you should not change the identifier
or AutoGallery SQL will create a new rejection e-mail instead of updating the old one.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="delete">Deleting</a></b>

<br />
<br />

To delete a rejection e-mail, make your way to the Rejection E-mails interface in the control panel.  Select the e-mail that you want to delete
from the drop down menu at the top of the page, and then press the Delete E-mail button.  The next time you process galleries, you will no longer
have that e-mail as an option.

<br />
<br />

<b>Special Identifier Values</b>

<br />
<br />

If you would like to have a rejection e-mail set as the default, you will need to use a special identifier for that e-mail message.  To set the
default rejection e-mail for galleries it should use the identifier RejectGallery.  To set the default rejection e-mail for partner account
requests it should use the identifier RejectPartner.

<br />
<br />

<b>Template Values</b>

<br />
<br />

There are several template values you can use in your rejection e-mails.

<br />
<br />

##Gallery_ID## - The ID number assigned to the gallery<br />
##Email## - The e-mail address for the gallery<br />
##Gallery_URL## - The URL for the gallery<br />
