If you are moving your installation to a new server, please follow the instructions in the <a href="servermove.html" class="link">Moving AutoGallery SQL to a New Server</a> portion of this manual.

<br />
<br />

Unless otherwise noted, you are licensed to use the software on a single domain. If you would like to use the software on more than
one domain, you will need to purchase additional licenses. Additional licenses may be purchased though the My Account interface in
the owners lounge at a discounted rate.

<br />
<br />

<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

At this point it is assumed you have extracted the archive containing AutoGallery SQL.
If you have not yet done so, you should do that now.

<br />
<br />

You should also have the following information on hand:

<br />
<br />

- The name of the MySQL database which you will be using to store the data*<br />
- The username which you use to access the MySQL database<br />
- The password which you use to access the MySQL database

<br />
<br />

If you do not have this information, contact your server administrator to get it.

<br />
<br />

* This name is not something you can just make up. The database must be created by your
server administrator in order for you to use it. If you don't know the name of a database
which you are allowed to use, contact your server administrator to get that information
or to have them create a database for you.  Some servers offer control panels where you
can create your own MySQL database.  In that case you will need to have created the MySQL
database before you continue.

<br />
<br />

<b>Locating Perl</b>

<br />
<br />

On most servers, this step is not necessary.  If your server has Perl located at /usr/bin/perl, you can skip this step.

<br />
<br />

You will need to locate Perl 5 on your server if it is not located at /usr/bin/perl. If you are not sure where to find it,
contact your server administrator and ask them. Generally it can be found at /usr/local/bin/perl if it is not at /usr/bin/perl

Now you will need to open each of the .cgi files in a text editor.  We recommend <a href="../../../../external.html?link=http://www.editplus.com/" class="link" target="_blank">EditPlus</a>
for Windows users.  Change the first line of each file to point to Perl 5 on your server. For example, if Perl 5 is at /usr/local/bin/perl,
then the first line will be #!/usr/local/bin/perl

<br />
<br />

<b>Creating Directories</b>

<br />
<br />

The next step is to login to your server and create the necessary directories for AutoGallery SQL.  First off, decide where you want the .cgi
files installed. Generally it is a good idea to keep them in the cgi-bin (or equivalent) directory. Once you have decided where you want the .cgi
files, change into that directory. Inside that directory you will need to create 3 subdirectories; name them templates, data, and admin. 
<span class="important">Note:</span> The only files you should place in these directories are those indicated in this documentation. 
Uploading other files to these directories will cause problems.

<br />
<br />

You will also need to create a directory to store the thumbnail preview images, even if you do not plan on using that feature of the
software.  This will need to be outside of the cgi-bin, and should be an empty directory dedicated to storing the thumbnails.  Do not 
upload your own thumbnails or other images to this directory, it is strictly for use by AutoGallery SQL and the software will delete any
files in that directory which do not belong.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>Example Directory Structure:</b>

<br />

<table width="100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">
<tr>
<td>/home/username/cgi-bin/tgp</td>    
<td>location of ags.pl and submit.cgi files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/home/username/cgi-bin/tgp/admin</td>          
<td>location of admin.cgi and main.cgi files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/home/username/cgi-bin/tgp/data</td>          
<td>location of script data files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/home/username/cgi-bin/tgp/templates</td>        
<td>location of all template files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/home/username/docs/tgp/thumbs</td>      
<td>where the preview thumbnails will be stored</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

<br />

<b>Uploading Files</b>

<br />
<br />

Now you are ready to begin uploading the files to your server.  <span class="important">VERY IMPORTANT:</span> All of the files included with
the software must be uploaded to your server in ASCII mode.  If you are not sure how to do this, consult the documentation for your FTP client.

<br />
<br />

Below is a table of where each file should be uploaded, using the example directory structure above:

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>/cgi-bin/tgp</b><br />
ags.pl<br />
code.cgi<br />
common.pl<br />
compiler.pl<br />
confirm.cgi<br />
cron.cgi<br />
http.pl<br />
image.pl<br />
init.cgi<br />
md5.pl<br />
mysql.pl<br />
partner.cgi<br />
remind.cgi<br />
report.cgi<br />
scanner.cgi<br />
size.pl<br />
submit.cgi<br />
thumb.cgi

<br /><br />

<b>/cgi-bin/tgp/admin</b><br />
admin.cgi<br />
main.cgi<br />
menu.cgi<br />
patch.cgi<br />
review.cgi<br />
xml.cgi

<br /><br />

<b>/cgi-bin/tgp/data</b><br />
agents<br />
default<br />
language<br />
referrers<br />
tables<br />
words

<br /><br />

<b>/cgi-bin/tgp/templates</b><br />
All files from the templates directory of the AutoGallery SQL distribution
</ul>

<br />

<b>Setting Permissions</b>

<br />
<br />

Next, you will need to set permissions on the directories and files that AutoGallery SQL will be
using. If you are not sure how to set permissions, consult the documentation for your FTP client 
and/or contact your server administrator for more information. Below is a table containing the
permissions you will need to set on each directory or file.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<table width="400" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0" style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#cccccc" align="center"><b>File or Directory</b></td>
<td bgcolor="#cccccc" align="center"><b>Permissions</b></td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>All .cgi files <span class="small">(unless otherwise noted)</span></td>
<td align="center">755</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>All .pl files</td>
<td align="center">644</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>scanner.cgi</td>
<td align="center">777</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>cron.cgi</td>
<td align="center">777</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>All files in the data directory</td>
<td align="center">666</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>All files in the templates directory</td>
<td align="center">666</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>data directory</td>
<td align="center">777</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>admin directory</td>
<td align="center">777</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>templates directory</td>
<td align="center">755</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ececec">
<td>Directory where thumbnails will be stored</td>
<td align="center">777</td>
</tr>
</table>

</ul>

<br />

These are only the recommended file permissions, and may need to be altered depending on your server configuration.

<br />
<br />

<span class="important">Important Note</span> Some servers do not allow CGI scripts to be located inside directories with 777 permissions.
If you get a 500 server error message when you try to access the scripts through your browser, try changing the permissions on the directory
that the scripts are located in.  For example, if you get that type of error when you access the admin.cgi script, change the permissions
on the admin directory from 777 to 755.

<br />
<br />

<b>Software Initialization</b>

<br />
<br />

You are now ready to begin the web based portion of the setup. In your browser, type in the full URL to the init.cgi file on your server.
The init.cgi script will run a few diagnostic tests to make sure your server has all of the required modules and that all of the permissions
have been set correctly.  If there are any problems, a page will be displayed that details them.  Instructions for correcting the problems can
also be found on that page.

<br />
<br />

If all of the diagnostic tests pass, you will see a page where you will need to enter your MySQL database information.  Complete instructions
are provided on that page. Once you have filled in all of the fields, press the Submit button.  The MySQL database information will be tested
to make sure it is working.  If it is not, you will get an error message indicating the problem.

<br />
<br />

If the MySQL information is entered correctly, you will be brought to a page that will have the URL and login information for the control panel.
Now is also a good time to change the permissions on the scanner.cgi and cron.cgi files.  They can be changed to 755 for both files.

<br />
<br />

<b>Accessing the Control Panel</b>

<br />
<br />

On the final screen of the init.cgi script you will find a link to the control panel.  Click that link and enter the login information indicated
on the final init.cgi screen.  This will log you into the control panel so you can setup the software's options.  The first time you login to the
control panel you will automatically be taken to the Edit Options interface.  On this page you will be able to enter the options you want AutoGallery
SQL to use.  Each of the options has a [?] after it, which you can click on to get more information about that field.  After you have set all of the
options how you want them, you can click on the Save Options button located at the top or bottom of the page.

<br />
<br />

<span class="important">Important Note</span> You will not be able to access the other functions of the software until you save your settings on
the Edit Options page.  Until you do this, every link that you click on in the control panel menu will take you to the Edit Options interface.

<br />
<br />

You are now ready to begin using the software.  From here you should read the <a href="firststeps.html" class="link">First Steps After Installation</a>
portion of the manual.  That will instruct you on what to do before you begin accepting gallery submissions.  


<br />
<br />

<span class="important">Help Prevent Software Piracy</span>

<br />
<br />

If you have uploaded the AutoGallery SQL zip (or tar or tar.gz) file to your server, remove it now. Leaving it on
your server provides a chance for other users to steal it from your web space. Make sure you never leave a copy of
the software where other people can access it.

<br />
<br />

Never share your software with anyone. The license you purchased is for your use only. You may not give or sell the software
to anyone under any circumstances. If you are caught doing this, you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

<br />
<br />

Never share your owners lounge username or password with anyone. Again, that is for your use only. We will never
ask for you to send your password to us, so if you ever get an e-mail requesting it you should not send it.

<br />
<br />

Do not upload the software documentation to your server or share it with anyone. We keep the documentation in the
owners lounge so only legitimate customers can access it. This makes it much more difficult for users of pirated
software to figure out how to use it.

<br />
<br />

If you ever find a site that is offering our software for download, please contact us immediately so we can have
the site shut down. Every time our software is pirated instead of purchased, it means less resources for us to continue
the development of this and future software.
