<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

Starting in version 3.1.0 of AutoGallery SQL, the software now includes a feature that will allow webmasters to request
a partner account at your TGP.   Webmasters will be able to provide you with information through a web-based form, such as
their name, some example gallery URLs, and who hosts their site.  Through the software's control panel you will be able to
decide who you want to be a partner, and quickly create partner accounts for those who have requested them.

<br />
<br />

<b>Requesting a Partner Account</b>

<br />
<br />

To request a partner account webmasters will need to visit the partner.cgi script that is included with the software.  By default
the submit form templates do not include a link to the partner account request form, since not everyone will use this feature.  If
you want to add a link to the partner account request form, simply link directly to the partner.cgi script.  When they visit this
script they will be presented with a form that they will need to fill in.  Each of the form fields is described below.

<ul>
<li> <b>E-mail Address</b> - This is the e-mail address that the webmaster would like to be contacted at<br />
<li> <b>Your Name</b> - This is the webmaster's name or nickname<br />
<li> <b>Requested Username</b> - This is the username that the webmaster would like to use for their partner account<br />
<li> <b>Requested Password</b> - This is the password that the webmaster would like to use for their partner account<br />
<li> <b>Sample URL 1</b> - This is the full URL to an example of one of their galleries that they would submit<br />
<li> <b>Sample URL 2</b> - This is the full URL to an example of one of their galleries that they would submit<br />
<li> <b>Sample URL 3</b> - This is the full URL to an example of one of their galleries that they would submit<br />
<li> <b>Hosting Company</b> - This is the webhosting company where their galleries are hosted<br />
<li> <b>Main Content Provider</b> -  This is the company that is the main provider of their gallery images and/or movies
</ul>

Once they have filled in the information, they can press the Submit Request button.  A confirmation page will be displayed to
let them know that their information will be reviewed and they will be contacted when that has been done.

<br />
<br />

<b>Moderating Partner Account Requests</b>

<br />
<br />

As the TGP administrator it will be your job to moderate the partner account requests and decide who gets a partner account
and who does not.  This is handled through the software's control panel by clicking on the Account Requests link in the
Partner Accounts section of the menu.  When the page loads you will see a listing of all of the new partner account requests.

<br />
<br />

Each partner account request starts with a gray bar that shows the approve and reject checkboxes.  Below that is all of the
information about the partner account request.  Each item is described below.

<ul>
<li> <b>Username</b> - This is the username that the webmaster requested; this item can be edited<br />
<li> <b>Password</b> - This is the password that the webmaster requested; this item can be edited<br />
<li> <b>E-mail</b> - This is the e-mail address that the webmaster submitted<br />
<li> <b>Galleries</b> - These are the 3 example galleries that the webmaster submitted<br />
<li> <b>Host</b> - This is the webhosting company where the webmaster's galleries are hosted<br />
<li> <b>Content</b> -  This is the company that is the main provider of the webmaster's gallery images and/or movies<br />
<li> <b>IP</b> -  This is the IP address of the webmaster who submitted the request
<li> <b>Weight</b> -  If you approve this request, this is the weight that will be assigned to all galleries submitted by this partner<br />
<li> <b>Per Day</b> -  If you approve this request, this is the number of galleries that the webmaster can submit each day<br />
<li> <b>Options</b> -  If you approve this request, these are several options that you can select from for the partner account<br />
  
    <ul>
    <li> <b>Auto-Approve</b> - If this is checked, this account's galleries will be automatically approved by AutoGallery SQL, otherwise
                      you will have to review them before they are approved.
    <li> <b>Recip Required</b> - If this is checked, any galleries submitted from this account must have a reciprocal link.
                        This value overrides the global options setting.
    <li> <b>Check Blacklist</b> - If this is checked, this partner's galleries will be checked against the blacklist.
    <li> <b>Check Banned HTML</b> - If this is checked, this partner's galleries will be checked against the banned HTML list.
    <li> <b>Confirm by E-mail</b> - If this is checked, this partner will have to confirm all gallery submissions by e-mail.
    </ul>
</ul>

Once you have decided what you want to do with each partner account request, put a checkbox in either the Approve or Reject checkbox.  You
can then press the Process Requests button to process the partner account requests that you have moderated.  If you have approved the request,
a new partner account will be created with the supplied username and password and the partner will be sent the contents of the email_account.tpl
e-mail template.  If you have rejected the request, it will be deleted from the database.  You can also select a custom rejection e-mail to be sent
from the drop down list next to the Reject checkbox.  You can create and modify custom rejection e-mails with the Rejection E-mails function of
the software.
