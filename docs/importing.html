<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

With AutoGallery SQL it is possible to import a large number of galleries into your database in two quick steps.  This is a nice feature if you
are just starting your TGP and need some galleries to get going, or if you want to add a bunch of your own galleries.

<br />
<br />

<b>Formatting Galleries</b>

<br />
<br />

To import galleries you will need to either place them in a text file or paste them into a text box in the gallery importing interface.
In either case, the format needs to be the same.  There should be only one gallery per line.  Each line should have pipe (|) delimited data,
with each field representing one piece of information about the gallery.  The pieces may be in any order, but that order must remain the
same throughout all of the galleries.  For example:

<ul>
<pre>
user1@email.com|http://www.galleryurl.com/pages/gallery1.html|Hardcore|15
user2@email.com|http://www.galleryurl.com/pages/gallery2.html|Teen|12
user3@email.com|http://www.galleryurl.com/pages/gallery3.html|Amateur|16
</pre>
</ul>

The above example has three galleries each with an e-mail address, gallery URL, category, and number of thumbnails.  Once you have your
galleries in the proper format, you can begin the importing process.

<br />
<br />

<b>Control Panel Interface</b>

<br />
<br />

Locate and click on the Import Galleries link in the Manage Galleries section of the control panel menu to access the gallery importing interface.
AutoGallery SQL will load a page where you will be able to tell the software if you want to import from a file that you uploaded or if you want to
paste your galleries into the supplied text box.  Each option is explained on the gallery importing interface.  You will need to press the Analyze
Input button if you have pasted data into the text box or the Analyze File button if you are importing from an uploaded text file.

<br />
<br />

After you press the correct Analyze button you will be taken to a page where you will see the first gallery split out into it's individual fields.
On the right hand site of the Import Galleries box you will see drop down menus.  From these menus you will need to select what each field represents.  
If one of the pieces of data for the gallery does not fit into any of the drop down menu options, select the SKIP option.  AutoGallery SQL will
ignore all SKIP fields when importing the galleries.

<br />
<br />

In addition to assigning each of the fields from the data you are importing, there are three additional items that you will need to setup.  Each of
those items is described below.

<ul>
<b>Gallery Status</b> - Select the status that should be assigned to each of the imported galleries.  Pending means that you will have to approve
the galleries before they will become eligible for display.  Approved means that the galleries will be immediately eligible for display.<br />
<b>Gallery Type</b> - Select the gallery type, either Submitted or Permanent, that should be assigned to each of the imported galleries.  If you have
specified the gallery type in the import data, select the 'From File' option.  More information on the difference between submitted and permanent
galleries can be found in the <a href="galleries.html" class="link">Galleries</a> section of the software manual.<br />
<b>Gallery Format</b> - Select the gallery format, either Pictures or Movies, that should be assigned to each of the imported galleries.  If you have
specified the gallery format in the import data, select the 'From File' option.  It is not possible to have the software automatically detect the 
gallery format during the import process, but you can run the gallery scanner to automatically set that after they have been imported.
</ul>

You now have the ability to configure some options that will affect how the galleries are imported.  In the Options section of the import screen 
you can check boxes next to each option to indicate if you want it to be applied during the import process.  Each item is self-explanitory.

<br />
<br />

Once you have each of the fields setup how you want it, press the Import Galleries button.  AutoGallery SQL will begin importing the galleries from the
data you have provided.  Once it is complete, it will return you to the same page with information on how many galleries were imported.

<br />
<br />

<b>Important Notes</b>

<br />
<br />

Only galleries which fit into one of your categories will be imported.  Any galleries that do not match one of your existing categories will be skipped
over and not imported into the database.  You can prevent this from happening by using the "If a gallery does not match an existing category put it in ..."
option.

<br />
<br />

The galleries that you import are not scanned during the import process.  That could potentially take several hours to complete, so it is something that
is better accomplished later by using the software's Gallery Scanner feature.  The point of the import function is to quickly get the galleries into your
database so they can be used right away.  If you want to do things like automatically create thumbnails, set the gallery format, or count the thumbnails
on the gallery, run the gallery scanner after you have imported the galleries.

<br />
<br />

If you are importing icons with your galleries, you will need to enter the icon identifier in the import data, and it will need to match exactly with 
the identifier name that has been configured in the Manage Icons control panel interface.  For example, if you have an icon named Hot that displays a
hot icon next to the gallery, you would need to use the identifier Hot exactly.  If you want to assign multiple icons, they should be in a comma separated
list like so: Hot,New

<br />
<br />

<b>Field Formats</b>

<br />
<br />

Some of the items that you may want to import have specific formats that must be met in order for the galleries to be imported correctly.  Each of those
is discussed below.

<ul>
<b>Type</b> - This must be one of Submitted or Permanent. This item is case sensitive.<br />
<b>Format</b> - This must be one of Pictures or Movies. This item is case sensitive.<br />
<b>Scheduled Date</b> - This field must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.<br />
<b>Delete Date</b> - This field must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
</ul>
