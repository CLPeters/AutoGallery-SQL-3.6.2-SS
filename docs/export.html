<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL's database export function allows you to quickly make a copy of your database so that it can be transferred to another AutoGallery SQL
installation.  The export function will create a file that contains all of your gallery data, categories, annotations, partner accounts, and preview thumbnails.
Detailed instructions for using these functions are outlined in this document.

<br />
<br />

<b>Exporting Your Database</b>

<br />
<br />

To export your database, locate and click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will then
display a page where you will find a few different database functions.  The second box is for the database export and import functions.  To export
your database all you need to do is fill in a filename and then press the Export button.

<br />
<br />

The export process may take a few minutes, so be sure to give it time to complete.  The export file will be created in the data directory of your
AutoGallery SQL installation.  To transfer this data into a second AutoGallery SQL installation, follow the instructions in the Importing section below.
<span class="important">Important Transfer Instructions</span> If you need to transfer the export file using FTP, make sure that you transfer it in
binary mode and not ASCII mode.

<br />
<br />

<b>Importing A Database</b>

<br />
<br />

The database import function can be used to import data from an export file that was created by a different AutoGallery SQL installation, but both must be
the same version.  For example, if you created the export file with version 3.6.1, you will need to be using exactly that version for your second AutoGallery SQL
installation in order to import from that file.  Using older or newer versions of AutoGallery SQL may prevent the data import process from working correctly.

<br />
<br />

The first step is to transfer the export file to the data directory of the AutoGallery SQL installation where you want to import the data.  There are
many ways to do this, depending on where the two installations are located (same server or different servers) and what type of server access you have.
The most universal way of doing it is to use your FTP program.  You can use your FTP program to download the export file to your computer, and then upload
it to the data directory of the second AutoGallery SQL installation.  <span class="important">Important Upload Instructions</span> When transferring the
export file, make sure you transfer it in binary mode, not ASCII.

<br />
<br />

<span class="red">VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</span><br />
Using the database import function will wipe out all of your current galleries, categories, partner accounts, and annotations before importing the data
from the export file.  This must be done in order for the new database information that is being imported to be properly synchronized.  Other items, such
as your TGP pages and their templates, reciprocal links, control panel accounts, partner account requests, etc will not be altered.

<br />
<br />

To import a database, locate and click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will then
display a page where you will find a few different database functions.  The second box is for the database export and import functions.  Enter the
filename of the export file in the text entry field and then click on the Import button.  This process may take a few minutes, so be sure to give
it time to complete. After enough time has elapsed, you can continue using the software as usual.
