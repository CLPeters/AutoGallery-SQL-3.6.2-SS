<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL's Raw SQL Query function allows you to execute standard SQL queries against the database.  This function is recommended only for
advanced users or if you have been provided with an SQL query from the tech support staff.  If you have experience working with MySQL queries, this
will allow you to run any type of UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT command on the MySQL database being used by AutoGallery SQL.

<br />
<br />

<b>Running Raw SQL Queries</b>

<br />
<br />

To run a raw SQL query, click on the Database Tools link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load a page
that will have a few database functions.  The last function on that page is the Raw SQL Query function.  You will need to enter the full query in the text
input box, and then click on the 'Execute Query' button in that section to run the database query.  When complete, you will be returned to the database tools
page and a message will show you that the query has been executed and the number of database table rows that have been affected.
