<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL allows you to create any number of partner accounts, each with it's own options.  With the partner accounts you can restrict who submits
galleries or have the galleries submitted through these accounts appear above the standard gallery submissions.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="add">Adding</a></b>

<br />
<br />

To add a partner account click on the Add Account link in the Partner Accounts section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load a page
where you will be able to enter the necessary information to create an account.  Each of the fields on that page is described below.

<br />

<ul>

<b>Account ID</b> - This is the account identifier that will be used when submitting galleries.<br />
<b>Password</b> - This is the password that will be used when submitting galleries.<br />
<b>E-mail</b> - This is the partner's e-mail address.<br />
<b>No E-mail/Send E-mail</b> - Select Send E-mail from the drop down box to send a welcome e-mail to the new account.<br />
<b>Weight</b> - This is the weight that will be assigned to galleries submitted through this account.<br />
<b>Galleries Per Day</b> - This is the maximum number of galleries that this account can submit per day.<br />
<b>Auto-Approve</b> - If you set this to yes, this account's galleries will be automatically approved by AutoGallery SQL, otherwise
                      you will have to review them before they are approved.<br />
<b>Recip Required</b> - If you set this to yes, any galleries submitted from this account must have a reciprocal link.
                        This value overrides the global options setting.<br />
<b>Check Blacklist</b> - If this is set to yes, galleries submitted through this account will be checked against the blacklist.  Set this to No if you do not want 
galleries submitted through this account to be checked against the blacklist.<br />
<b>Check Banned HTML</b> - If this is set to yes, galleries submitted through this account will be checked against the banned HTML list.  Set this to No if you do not want 
galleries submitted through this account to be checked against the banned HTML list.<br />
<b>Confirm By E-mail</b> - If this option is set to yes, this partner will need to confirm all of their submissions by e-mail.  If it is set to no, they will not have
to confirm their submissions by e-mail.
</ul>

Once all of the options have been filled in how you want them, press the Add Account button.  The new account will be created and you will
be returned to the Add Account page where you can create more accounts if you wish.  Immediately after addition the new partner account will
be active and the user can begin submitting galleries.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="manage">Managing</a></b>

<br />
<br />

To manage your partner accounts click on the Manage Accounts link in the Partner Accounts section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL will load
a page where you will be able to view, search, edit, and delete your partner accounts.  This image shows what you will see when managing your partner

<br />

<br />
<br />

delete the partner account, and the username and password for that account will no longer be active.  Deleting a partner account will also delete 
all of the galleries in the database that were submitted by the account.


<br />
<br />

<b>Partner End-User Interface</b>

<br />
<br />

The partner account end-user interface allows your partners to login and view the galleries they currently have in your database, the number of clicks each
gallery has received, disable their galleries if needed, and edit their account.  To allow your partners to view that information and edit their account you
will need to provide a link to partner.cgi?r=login  From that page partners will be able enter their current username and password and then be presented with
a page where they can see their galleries and edit their account.
