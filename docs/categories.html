<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL supports unlimited categories for your galleries.  Each category can have it's own settings to determine what type of galleries will be
accepted into that category.  Your categories are managed through the control panel and can be added, updated, or deleted at any time.  To access
the category management interface click on the Manage Categories link in the Setup section of the control panel menu.

<br />
<br />

The first time you visit the category management interface, you will only have the option to add categories.  Once you have added some categories you
will have further options to update and delete them.  The process of adding, updating and deleting galleries is described below.


<br />
<br />

<b><a name="add">Adding</a></b>

<br />
<br />

The first time you visit the Manage Categories interface you will be presented with a form where you can add new categories.  If you have already added
some categories, click on the 'Add New Categories' link at the bottom of the page to access the form where you can add new categories.

<br />
<br />

On the Add New Categories form there are several fields that you will need to fill in to add new categories.  Each of those fields is described below.

<ul>
<b>Category Names</b> - Enter the names of the categories, as you want them to appear, in this field.  List one category name per line.<br />
<b>Make these categories hidden</b> - Check this box if you want the categories you are adding to be hidden.  More on this later.<br />
<b>File Extensions</b> - Enter the allowed file extensions for both picture and movie galleries in these fields.  More on this later.<br />
<b>Minimum Amount</b> - Enter the minimum amount of items that must appear on the gallery in order for it to be accepted.<br />
<b>Maximum Amount</b> - Enter the maximum amount of items that can appear on the gallery in order for it to be accepted.<br />
<b>Minimum File Size</b> - Enter the minimum allowed file size of the gallery content.<br />
<b>Annotations</b> - Select which annotations, if any, you want to use for the preview thumbnails in this category.<br />
<b>Maximum Submissions Allowed Per Day</b> - Enter the maximum number of galleries that can be submitted to this category each day.<br />
</ul>

Once you have all of the fields filled in how you want them, press the Add Categories button to save your categories.  You will be returned
to the category management page where you can make any further changes that you want.

<br />
<br />

<b>File Extensions</b>

<br />
<br />

The file extensions settings for each category have a couple of different functions.  First, they help the software to determine what format the gallery
is (either pictures or movies).  For example, if the software finds that a gallery has 5 links to files that have picture extensions and 3 links to files that
have movie extensions, it will say that the gallery format is pictures since there are more picture than movie links.

<br />
<br />

Second, they tell the software what gallery formats are allowed in each category.  If you have a category that you only want to allow movie galleries,
leave the pictures file extensions field empty.  This will tell the software that picture galleries are not allowed in that category.  You can do the same
thing for categories where you only want picture galleries.

<br />
<br />

<b>Hidden Categories</b>

<br />
<br />

For the most part, hidden categories act just like normal categories.  The only difference is that a hidden category will not appear on the gallery submission
form,.  Even if someone discovers the name of one of your hidden categories they still cannot submit galleries to that category through the submission form.
With hidden categories, galleries can only be added to that category through the software control panel.

<br />
<br />

Note that hidden categories do not affect which galleries appear on your TGP pages.  Galleries in hidden categories have the same eligibility for display on
your TGP pages as galleries in all other categories.  The only difference between hidden and normal categories is the ability to submit galleries to them through
the gallery submission form.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="update">Updating</a></b>

<br />
<br />

Categories can be edited one at a time or several at a time.  After you have added some categories, you will be shown the 'Manage Existing Categories' interface
each time that you visit the Manage Categories interface.  To edit a single category, select it from the list of categories in the 'Existing Categories' selection
field.  AutoGallery SQL will load all of that category's options in the form fields, and you can then make the changes you want.  Once you have made the changes you
want, press the Update Selected button.  You will be returned to the category management page where you can make any further changes that you want.

<br />
<br />

To edit several categories you can select each of them in the 'Existing Categories' selection field.  On a Windows based computer this is done by holding down
the Crtl key on your keyboard as you click on each category name.  For Mac users, hold down the command key on your keyboard as you click each category name.
Once you have made the changes you want, press the Update Selected button.  You will be returned to the category management page where you can make any further
changes that you want.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="raname">Renaming</a></b>

<br />
<br />

To rename an existing category you can use the Manage Categories interface.  Below the 'Manage Existing Categories' section you will find a section labeled 
'Rename a Category'.  In that section select the category you want to rename from the drop down list.  Enter the new name for the category in the New Name
field and then press the Rename button.  The software will take care of renaming the category and updating all of the galleries in that category with the new
name.  However, if there are any references to the old category name in your TGP page templates, you will need to update those manually.

<br />
<br />

<b><a name="delete">Deleting</a></b>

<br />
<br />

Categories can be deleted one at a time or several at a time.  To delete a single category, select it from the drop down list of categories at the top of the
page.  Press the Delete Selected button to delete the category.  You will be returned to the category management page where you can make any further changes that you want.

<br />
<br />

To delete several categories you can select each of them in the 'Existing Categories' selection field.  On a Windows based computer this is done by holding down
the Crtl key on your keyboard as you click on each category name.  For Mac users, hold down the command key on your keyboard as you click each category name.
Press the Delete Selected button to delete the categories you have selected.  You will be returned to the category management page where you can make any further
changes that you want.

<br />
<br />

Note that deleting a category will also delete all of the galleries in that category.  If you do not want to delete all of the galleries in the category you
are deleting, you will first need to move them into a category that you will not be deleting.  This can be done through the Display Galleries interface.
