<b>Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

AutoGallery SQL allows you to view a breakdown of your galleries by their type and status.  You can see how many submitted galleries there are with
each status and how many permanent galleries there are with each status.  You can also do a further breakdown by vewing each status by date or category.

<br />
<br />

<b>Viewing the Breakdown</b>

<br />
<br />

To view your gallery breakdown, locate and click on the Gallery Breakdown link in the Manage Galleries section of the control panel menu.  AutoGallery SQL
will load a page which will show you the breakdown by type and status.  You can click on the [By Date] or [By Category] links to get a further breakdown of
that particular gallery status and type.
